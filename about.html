                <p>
                    As-Salaam-Alaikum,
                    <br><br>
                    We have put a lot of effort to build a user-friendly and fast website. This has not always gone
                    without a hitch, but today alhamdoulillaah we may be cautiously satisfied with the results achieved
                    so far.
                    There is always room for improvement and we will continue to pay the necessary attention to the
                    further
                    development of the website in order to serve our brothers and sisters even better.<br><br>
                    QuranOnline.net has in the first place been created to offer the Muslim community and others the
                    opportunity to read, listen and learn the Holy Quran. To achieve this first goal, we have also
                    invested a lot of time and energy into:
                    <br><br>
                    As you have probably noticed, we also offer our visitors the opportunity to view prayer times. Our
                    aim is to provide everyone with local prayer times and by local we mean really local!
                    <br><br>
                    In the first instance, the location was automatically detected based on the user’s IP address.
                    However, this was not always accurate. At the request of our visitors, we have now implemented some
                    improvements. Now it is possible to determine the location very accurately through the added GPS
                    functionality. However, you must enable the “location service” on your device and then allow
                    QuranOnline.net to use your location!
                    <br><br>
                    Alhamdoulillaah now more and more visitors find us and may Allah reward them richly for reading the
                    Quran and performing their prayers on time. These positive developments in combination with the
                    great feedback we receive from our visitors does motivate us to further develop the website insha
                    Allah. If you have any good ideas and would like to share them with us, don’t hesitate to contact
                    us.<br><br>
